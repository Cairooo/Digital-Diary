# 📝 Digital Diary

**Digital Diary** is a simple web application created to demonstrate my understanding of **HTTP methods** such as **GET, POST, and DELETE**.  

The app simulates a digital diary, allowing users to record their thoughts and notes in a straightforward way.  
Please note that this project does **not use a database**, so all data is temporary and lost when the application stops.
